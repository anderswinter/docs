<Steps>
    <Step title="Turn on the PC and VR headset">
        Turn on the VR headset by holding the button on the right side, waiting for it to blink. You can confirm that the VR headset is on, by mounting it on your head and checking that the virtual world shows.

If you are in a new location, the VR headset might ask you to setup a new "Boundary" - This is your play area and it helps you stay safe when navigating the virtual world. 

    </Step>

    <Step title="Connect the VR headset to the PC using the Meta Link Cable">
        You need to establish the connection between the VR headset and the PC before you can start the X-ray Simulator. Therefore make sure to connect the Link cable to both the VR Headset and the PC. Make sure the connection is solid as there is nothing more annoying than losing the connection mid-simulation.

    </Step>

    <Step title="Start the Meta Link connection using the VR headset menu">
        To activate the connection, mount the VR headset and locate the option to activate Meta Link. This options might pop-up by it self. You know that you have successfully connected the headset to the PC when the you find your self in an infinitely big room with white floor tiles.

<Tip>
    If you are having trouble connecting to the PC try unplugging and reattaching the link cable to the headset. If this does not work, try restarting the VR headset.
</Tip>

    </Step>

    <Step title="Start the X-Ray Simulator on the PC">
        When the VR headset is successfully connected, peak out from the VR headset, locate the X-ray simulator on the desktop and start the application. Be sure to start the VR X-ray simulator, as it is a common mistake to start the Desktop X-ray Simulator.
