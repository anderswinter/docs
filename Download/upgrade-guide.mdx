description: "This guide explains how to update your X-Ray Simulator to the latest version. The process is simple, but please read the notes below carefully - especially if your computer is managed by your institution’s IT department."

### If Your Institution Uses Central or Silent Deployment

If your IT department normally installs or updates software automatically (for example, through a silent install, software center, or central distribution system), please do not attempt a manual upgrade.

Instead:

- Notify your IT department that a new version is available.
- Share the download link and ask them to deploy it when convenient.

<Note>
  Tip for IT Administrators The installer supports standard Windows silent install parameters. For details or deployment documentation, see [MDM Installation](/Tech/mdm-deployment-instructions)
</Note>
