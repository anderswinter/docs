## Important Information for IT Departments

The Desktop X-Ray Simulator is distributed as a standalone `.exe` installer.\
To deploy the application silently through your MDM system, please use the command provided below.

## Official Silent Install Command

```bash
"SIGNED_Setup Desktop X-Ray Simulator v1.0.0-rc.2.exe" /verysilent /norestart /suppressmsgboxes /log="C:\Windows\Temp\XRaySimulatorInstall.log"
```

This ensures:

- **Fully silent installation** (no windows, no user interaction)
- **No system reboot** after installation
- **Suppressed message boxes** (avoiding any pop-up warnings)
- **Logging enabled** for troubleshooting (`C:\Windows\Temp\XRaySimulatorInstall.log`)

### Installer Behavior

- Application installs by default to:

  ```bash
  C:\Program Files\VitaSim\Desktop X-Ray Simulator\
  ```
- No license entry or additional configuration is required at install time.
- Installation must be run with **administrative privileges**.

### Silent Uninstallation (Optional)

If a silent uninstall command is required, use:

```bash
"C:\Program Files\VitaSim\Desktop X-Ray Simulator\unins000.exe" /verysilent /norestart /suppressmsgboxes /log="C:\Windows\Temp\XRaySimulatorUninstall.log"
```

### Detection Rule Suggestion

If your MDM solution requires a detection rule to verify successful installation, we recommend checking for the existence of:

```bash
C:\Program Files\VitaSim\Desktop X-Ray Simulator\Desktop X-Ray Simulator.exe
```

Detection can also optionally be based on the presence of the application's uninstall registry entry if preferred.

## Notes

- Administrative rights are necessary for both installation and uninstallation.
- If needed, the install log at `C:\Windows\Temp\XRaySimulatorInstall.log` can be reviewed to verify installation success or troubleshoot any issues.
